# PIPELINE TEMPLATEs

## Based on brewtech pipelines

This pipeline purpose is provide code analysis and development/QA environments delivery.
Whenever you open a Pull Request to develop ou release/* branches, the pipeline will:

- Run Dependency Track analysis
- Run SonarQube analysis (with test running)
- Run Docker image build (without pull)

When you merge code at develop and release/* a new code validation will start and if it be successful, then a delivery process will be started, pulling e deploying a new docker imagem/deployment file at k8s.
